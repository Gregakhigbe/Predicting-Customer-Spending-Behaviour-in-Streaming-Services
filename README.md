# Predicting-Customer-Spending-Behaviour-in-Streaming-Services
The project aimed to use supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to forecast customer spending patterns in a streaming services dataset. Regression models, Random Forest Regressor, and Artificial Neural Networks were generated to improve prediction performance. Classification models were developed to predict consumer churn. Results showed that combining characteristics increased regression accuracy, and Multi-feature and ANN models outperformed basic methods. k-Means provided efficient customer segmentation.
